HTTP1:
1. In HTTP1, client sends request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST.
2. GET fetches the data that you have asked for.
3. HTTP1 uses text based requests to the server.
4. Sometimes when using GET request we will not get a completely rendered page,in this case we have to send multiple requests to get additional resources,which can be time and resource consuming.
5. Multiple use of TCP connections required to connect with the machines.

HTTP2:
1. In HTTP2,it uses binary layer to include all messages in binary format.
2. HTTP2 encodes GET and POST methods in binary format.
3. HTTP2 establishes a single connection object between the two machines. Within this connection there are multiple streams of data. Each stream consists of multiple messages in the the format.
4. Since binary format is used the pages will be fully rendered in a single request.
5. Only 1 TCP/Ip connection is needed ,which will improve the efficiency of the system
