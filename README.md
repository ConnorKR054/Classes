The <div> element is the most general purpose element. It has no special meaning. It’s purpose is to group content that is not semantically relatedThe <div> element, therefore, is mainly used to group content for targeting with CSS. For example, as a styling container for other elements.
  
  The <section> element is slightly more specific that a <div>. It is applied to a generic section of content that can be grouped together in a semantically meaningful way.A section’s “theme” should be defined by including a heading element within the element, often immediately after the opening tag.
  
  The <article> element is even more specific than a <section>. It is also applied to a section of content that is semantically related, and should also have a heading. However, this section of content should additionally be "self-contained". This means that the contents of an <article> should be able to be isolated from the rest of the page and still be meaningful.
